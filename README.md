# PyLab

Welcome to my **PyLab** – a growing collection of Python scripts written for experimentation, learning, and utility purposes. This repository contains various standalone Python scripts that demonstrate different concepts, tools, and use cases in Python programming.

## 📂 Structure

The scripts are organized by topic or functionality. You may find scripts related to:

* 🔁 **Loops & Conditionals**
* 🧮 **Data Structures & Algorithms**
* 📊 **Data Analysis / Visualization**
* 🌐 **Web Scraping / APIs**
* 🧪 **Testing & Debugging**
* 🔐 **Security / Cryptography Basics**
* 🖥️ **System / Automation Tools**
* 🎮 **Mini Games / Simulations**

> *Note: Folders and filenames are self-explanatory. Comments within the scripts provide additional context where needed.*

## 🛠 Requirements

Most scripts only require the Python standard library. However, some may depend on external packages.

To install all optional dependencies (if provided), you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, dependencies may be listed at the top of individual scripts.


## 📚 Learning Goals

This repo serves as:

* A personal learning lab to explore Python topics
* A handy toolbox of reusable code
* A reference point for fellow learners

## 📌 Contributions

Suggestions, improvements, or new script ideas are always welcome! Feel free to fork the repo, make changes, and submit a pull request.
